ðŸ“˜ Abstract
This repository contains the core work and architecture behind a scalable ASCII Acknowledgment Response System implemented for ShapeDrive G4 sensors, high-precision 3D machine vision devices used in industrial automation.
The primary objective of this thesis is to design and implement a robust, modular, and low-latency ASCII command acknowledgment system using XML containers, enhancing command feedback, reliability, and debugging capabilities of the embedded sensor firmware.
